The candle flames seem to waver in response, casting dancing shadows that make the stone walls appear to shift and breathe. From behind the polished oak bar, Magnus pauses his glass-polishing, his silver eyebrows lifting slightly as he studies you with those knowing eyes.\n\n\"Testing games, are we?\" he rumbles, a faint smile touching his lips. \"Well, you've come to the right place for secrets - though most here prefer dice and cards to whatever game you're playing.\" His gaze drops meaningfully to your worn leather pouch before returning to your face. \"Storm's still howling out there. Might be you'll want something warmer than copper coins in your pocket before venturing back into it.\"\n\nAs he speaks, you notice a peculiar pattern carved into the base of the bar near his hand - three interlocking circles that seem to shimmer faintly in the candlelight. From the shadowy corner booth, a low chuckle echoes, though you can't quite make out who sits there in the dimness. The air grows heavy with the scent of pine smoke and something else... something metallic and strange that wasn't there moments before.\n\nDo you:\n- Ask Magnus about the strange symbol on the bar\n- Investigate the source of the mysterious chuckle from the corner\n- Order a drink despite your limited coins\n- Something else entirely?",
